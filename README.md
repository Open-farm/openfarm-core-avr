#### core-avr

Core libraries for AVR development. This code base is an attempt to make it easier to jump start more serious AVR projects.

##### Building

The core libraries can be built using `gradle`. Under the hood, we leverage `make` to do the heavy lifting. Check out the **[build process documentation](docs/build-process.overview.md)** for further reading.
